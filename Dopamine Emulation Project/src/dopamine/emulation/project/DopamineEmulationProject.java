/*
 *  HEADER NOTE FOR MAT:
 * 
 * This is the project thus far, I haven't had much time to code, but I've done
 * a lot of reading and made a skeleton that just needs to be filled out.
 * 
 * I think that it would be best to make the agent and the critic first, then 
 * working on the environment.

/**
 * Edited 21/12/12:
 * 
 *  Needed : 
 *      Timer -- For task switching and delays in the process -- just a gettime ()
 *      Actor -- Flesh out the tasks that are required
 *      Critic -- How are the constants derived and overall structure
 *      Some form of repository for sharing with other people (git?)
