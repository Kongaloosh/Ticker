### What is this?

This is a project I built in the first year of my computer science program at the University of Edinburgh. Specifically,
this was made in a week for the Innovative Learning Week Smart Data Hack.

I scrape data from Yahoo! finance and feed it to some SARSA agents which decided whether to buy, sell or hold a stock.
Additionally, some news stories are scraped and rudimentary sentiment analysis is done.

This isn't polished or really that accurate, but it's my first large-project.
